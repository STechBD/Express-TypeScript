It is about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers. Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity. Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris. Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597. The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality, however, and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare's original. Shakespeare's use of his poetic dramatic structure, especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, his expansion of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story, has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play. Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical and opera venues. During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. David Garrick's 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and Georg Benda's Romeo und Julie omitted much of the action and added a happy ending. Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman's, restored the original text and focused on greater realism. John Gielgud's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. In the 20th and into the 21st century, the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor's comparatively faithful 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version, Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet and the 2013 movie adaptation starring Douglas Booth, Hailee Steinfeld, Damian Lewis and Paul Giamatti."]}, {"tag": "en_hamlet", "pattern": ["Hamlet", "What is Hamlet?", "Who wrote Hamlet?", "Who is the writer of Hamlet?", "Who is the creator of Hamlet?", "Tell me about Hamlet.", "Tell me something about Hamlet.", "What is the story of Hamlet?", "What is the summary of Hamlet?", "What is the topic of Hamlet?"], "response": ["**Hamlet** is a tragedy written by English playwright William Shakespeare.

The play explores themes of revenge, treachery, moral corruption, and the consequences of indecision. The moral of the story can be interpreted in many ways, but one common interpretation is the destructive consequences of revenge and the moral corruption that comes with power.

It is also the third most abundant substance in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. Water is a polar molecule, meaning that it has a partial positive charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other. This polarity allows water molecules to form hydrogen bonds with each other, which gives water its unique properties. Water is essential for life as we know it. It is used in many chemical reactions, and it is the main component of all living organisms. Water is also a solvent, meaning that it can dissolve many substances. This property allows water to transport nutrients and waste products throughout the body. Water is also a lubricant, meaning that it reduces friction between surfaces. This property allows water to protect joints and organs from damage. Water is also a coolant, meaning that it absorbs heat from the body and releases it into the environment.
